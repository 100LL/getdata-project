This data set is based on measurements taken from the accelerometer and gyroscope of a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II).  It contains the averages of the mean and standard deviations of the features from the original data.  There are 180 rows, each representing one of the 30 subjects performing one of the 6 activities.  The original data set is described at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.  

The 33 measurements are: 
<pre>
tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag
</pre>

('-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.)

For each of the measurements the following variables are included:
<pre>
mean: Mean value
std: Standard deviation
</pre>

This results in the 66 variables in the data set (plus columns for subject and activity).
